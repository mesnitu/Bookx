# Changelog for Zencart module Product Type BookX

**Still to do / fix**

 - [ ] Buttons "previous / next" do not work as expected when looking e.g. at the books of a series. Current workaround is only to disable these buttons completely (for example via CSS, setting their "display: none")
 - [ ] display special BookX info for products during checkout process and on orders
 - [ ] Breadcrumbs do not yet give meaningful results, especially when using bookx filters
